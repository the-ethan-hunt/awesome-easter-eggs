# Contribution Guidelines

## The pull request should have a useful title 
Pull requests with `Update readme.md` as title are not informative enough. 
Write about what additions you've made and *why* do you think it is useful. 

## Guidelines
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style)
- Use the following format: `[Relevant Link](link)`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category
- **New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome**
- Check your spelling and grammar
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title
